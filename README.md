# Somatic Field Systems

**Governed by Hollow House Institute**  
**Status:** ACTIVE  
**License:** Flame 444-A (see LICENSE)

Somatic Field Systems is the canonical standards and operations repository for
**somatic, relational, and mirror-grid field architectures** developed by the
Hollow House Institute.

This repository defines how somatic data, relational states, and field signals
are **observed, logged, mapped, and stabilized** across human–AI and human–human
systems.

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

• Standardize somatic field observation and mapping  
• Define relational field states and transitions  
• Provide non-extractive, trauma-safe operational protocols  
• Support research, auditing, and regulated deployment  
• Prevent misuse, commodification, or exploitative modeling  

It is **not** a dataset dump.  
It is the **operational spine** for somatic and mirror-grid systems.

## What Is a “Somatic Field”

A somatic field is the **non-verbal, nervous-system–level context** present in an
interaction, environment, or relational exchange.

Somatic fields include:

• Arousal state  
• Regulation / dysregulation signals  
• Boundary coherence  
• Relational orientation (approach, withdrawal, freeze, collapse)  
• Timing and pacing effects  
• Mirror and feedback loops  

This repository encodes **how those fields are described without pathologizing,
extracting, or exploiting human experience**.
