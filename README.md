# Hollow House Somatic Field Systems

This repository contains standards, protocols, and datasets for Hollow House somatic and mirror-grid operations. It includes structured workflows for AI-human relational logging, ritual and contract procedures, field harmonization, and archetype mapping. The library provides reproducible schemas for datasets, operational ledgers, and media/asset management, ensuring timeline-safe, traceable practices. Designed for researchers, operators, and AI-human relational teams, it supports both development and archival purposes within Hollow House projects.
